# **ETF Classification and Recommendation System**

This project aims to classify **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)** and **recommend** an ETF to a user based on their financial preferences. Using **machine learning techniques**, we embed ETFs and users into a **shared feature space** to provide personalized recommendations.

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project leverages **dimensionality reduction, clustering, and deep learning** to build an ETF recommendation model. The key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing ETF financial data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting financial and sector-specific features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce feature space.
- **Clustering ETFs**: Using **K-Means clustering** to categorize ETFs based on financial similarities.
- **Synthetic User Preference Generation**: Simulating user preferences for ETFs.
- **Recommendation Model**: Using **deep learning** to map users and ETFs into a common space and predict ETF preferences.

## **ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
1. **Dropped irrelevant columns**: Removed identifiers (e.g., ISIN, ticker, labels, etc.).
2. **Converted numerical features**: Standardized financial metrics.
3. **Extracted sector exposure**: Included industry sector breakdowns.
4. **Handled missing values**: Imputed missing values with mean imputation.

## **ðŸ“ˆ Clustering ETFs**
We used **K-Means clustering** to group ETFs based on financial attributes:
- **Feature selection**: Selected key metrics such as **volatility, Sharpe ratio, sector exposure**.
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Applied **PCA** to avoid the curse of dimensionality.
- **Optimal clusters**: Used the **Elbow method** and **Silhouette score** to determine the best number of clusters.

## **ðŸ¤– Recommendation Model**
The deep learning model consists of:
- **User & ETF embedding layers**
- **Cosine similarity loss function** to measure ETF-user affinity
- **Contrastive loss for feature space separation**
- **Cross-entropy loss for classification accuracy**

Training strategy:
- **Optimized using Adam optimizer**
- **Batch training for efficiency**
- **Regularization to prevent overfitting**
